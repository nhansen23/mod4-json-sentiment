{"lyrics": "I feel like new sunglasses, like a brand new pair of jeans\r\nI feel like taking chances, I feel a lot like seventy\r\nI feel like windows rolled down, new city, streets and cabs\r\nI feel like anything can happen, laughing,\r\nYou take me right back, when we were kids\n\nNever thought I'd feel like this\n\n\n\nLike when I close my eyes and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing\n\nLike I can fly, and don't even think of touching the ground\n\nLike a heartbeat skip, like an open page\n\nLike a one way trip on an aeroplane\n\nIt's the way that I feel when I'm with you, brand new\n\nBrand new\n\n\n\nI feel like a young John Cusack, like making big mistakes\n\nI feel like for the first time in a long time I am not afraid\n\nI feel like a kid, never thought it'd feel like this\n\n\n\nLike when I close my eyes and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing\n\nLike I can fly, and don't even think of touching the ground\n\nLike a heartbeat skip, like an open page\n\nLike a one way trip on an aeroplane\n\nIt's the way that I feel when I'm with you, brand new\n\n\n\nTime will always try to make us\n\nYou remind me what I used to know\n\n\n\nLike when I close my eyes and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing\n\nLike I can fly, and don't even think of touching the ground\n\nLike a heartbeat skip, like an open page\n\nLike a one way trip on an aeroplane\n\nIt's the way that I feel when I'm with you, brand new\n\n\n\nBrand new, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nAnd I feel brand new\n\nI feel brand new\n\nI feel brand new"}
